## Completed Animes
List of Completed Animes and Ratings with Reviews that people will totally read!

### 18if - 1 Season - 7/10
Low budget anime. Pretty solid story line but it gets repetitive after a while

### A Certain Magical Index - 3 Seasons - 8.9/10
Good Story and Character Design. One of my top animes but sadly for me, Third season flopped and I kinda don't get the hype out of it unlike the previous Seasons. Good Series Overall

### A Certain Scientific Railgun - 3 Seasons - 9.3/10
A side story from A Certain Magical Index featuring the Life of Misaka Mikoto with her friends. The story is slightly better than Index but not to the point where you can say that "It's better than Index". Also Good Series I would recommend.

### A Cerain Scientific Accelerator - 1 Season - 8/10
Not really into Accelerator but damn it was better than what I have expected. I couldn't put it into words but to whoever is reading this you should give it a try.

### Hibike! Euphonium - 2 Seasons 2 Movies - 11/10
One of my personal Favorites! People would shrug this anime off as "K-on 2.0" but it's not and the only way you would know is to watch the show. I highly recommend this one

### The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya - 14(6) Episodes - 6/10
Generic Supernatural Anime. Endless Eight def dropped the rating for most people.

### K-on! - 2 Seasons 1 Movie - 9.7/10
One if not my favourite series in this entire list. I have watched this 14x now and I'm not stopping

### Liz to Aoi Tori - Movie - I would kill to watch this/10
Well altough this is a movie based off Hibike, I thought it would be nice to have it on a seperate rating because of how much I LOVE this movie. The story line really gets you. The design is something you don't often see in animes. It is an enjoyable ride of emotional rollercoaster and you will enjoy it to the max. spoilers : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnvpIX_193I

### Lycoris Recoil - 13 Episodes - 12/10
Yuri this and Yuri that my all favourite

### Mikagura School Suite - 1 Season - 8.7/19
Yuri anime, Cute Girls doimg cute things. Literally MY TYPE of anime but dropped the rating because of the animation that seemed lazy

### Spy x Family - 1 Season - 10/10
Couldn't say much here but this one bangs

### Violet Evergarden - 1 Season 2 Movies - 15/10
KyoAni employees needs to ge arrested for making this anime ITS SO GOOD OH MY GOD I CRIED

### U149 - 1 Season - 7.8/10
Mid ish anime(?) but enjoyable nonetheless
